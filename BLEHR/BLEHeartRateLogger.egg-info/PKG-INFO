        =====================
        
        BLEHeartRateLogger.py is a Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Heart Rate Monitor (HRM) data logger written in Python for Linux. With this tool you can log your heart rate and heart rate variability (RR) during exercise, sleep or whatever comes to mind.
        
        Communication with the BLE HRM is established using `hcitool` and `gatttool`. The output of those tools is then parsed and saved to an sqlite database.
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        On Debian/Ubuntu:
        ```
        $ apt-get install bluetooth python-pexpect
        $ git clone https://github.com/fg1/BLEHeartRateLogger.git
        ```
        
        Run the script as root user or correctly specify the rights on `hcitool` and `gatttool`.
        
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        To start the tool (as root or with correct rights):
        ```
        # ./BLEHeartRateLogger.py
        2015-01-10 13:40:59,326  Trying to find a BLE device
        2015-01-10 13:41:00,856  Establishing connection to 00:11:22:33:44:55
        2015-01-10 13:41:01,115  Connected to 00:11:22:33:44:55
        2015-01-10 13:41:03,412  Heart rate: 65
        2015-01-10 13:41:04,357  Heart rate: 65
        ```
        
        To quit the tool, simply Ctrl-C.
        
        
        Command line options:
        ```
        usage: BLEHeartRateLogger.py [-h] [-m MAC] [-b] [-g PATH] [-o FILE] [-v]
        
        Bluetooth heart rate monitor data logger
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          -m MAC      MAC address of BLE device (default: auto-discovery)
          -b          Check battery level
          -g PATH     gatttool path (default: system available)
          -o FILE     Output filename of the database (default: none)
          -v          Verbose output
        ```
        
        
        
        ##Â Troubleshooting
        
        In case the tool is not able to connect to your BLE HRM, first check manually that your computer and BLE HRM device are able to talk to eachother using the following steps (as root).
        ```
        # hcitool lescan
        ```
        This should list the BLE devices around you with their MAC address with something which looks like this: 00:11:22:33:44:55. You can safely Ctrl-C when the device has been found. We will the connect to the device:
        ```
        # gatttool -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -I
        ```
        This should open a prompt. Type the following commands:
        ```
        > connect
        > characteristics
        > exit
        ```
        
        In case one of the steps mentionned above fails, check your Linux installation and eventually `bluez` version (>= v.5 recommended).
